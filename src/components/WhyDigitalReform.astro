      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Adapting to a New Economic Era</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        We already live in a digital and information-based economy, yet our administrative 
        and state structures still operate with industrial-era logic. This fundamental 
        misalignment hampers our potential.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Instead of merely translating outdated administrative processes into technological solutions, 
        we must redesign administrative processes from the ground up, optimizing for technology.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        <span class={accentClass + " font-semibold"}>Digital reform is not just digitization</span> - it's a profound 
        shift in how we think about the state and economy, treating them as a software project 
        built from scratch with efficiency and modernity in mind.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Europe as a Unified Economic Organism</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        To meet the great engineering and industrial challenges of our time, Europe must function 
        as a unified economic organism. Only by working together at scale can we be competitive 
        in the global economy.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <span class={accentClass + " font-semibold"}>Linguistic and digital integration</span> are the foundations that will 
        enable functioning as a single organism - allowing us to effectively communicate 
        and collaborate across borders.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        When we remove communication and bureaucratic barriers, we'll unleash Europe's immense 
        creative and industrial potential, enabling ambitious continent-scale projects.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">The Economic Imperative</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Optimizing administrative, tax, and legal processes through digitization will 
        radically transform the entire economy. Applying economies of scale and IT approaches 
        to state management will bring enormous savings.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Instead of 27 different administrative systems, we can build one shared system, 
        pooling development and maintenance costs. This means better systems at lower costs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        <span class={accentClass + " font-semibold"}>Transitioning from paper-based to digital processes</span> is not just 
        about convenience, but a fundamental shift in the efficiency of the entire economy.

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Robotization is an essential element of modern defense. Eastern European and Scandinavian 
        countries, threatened by Russia, have a vital interest in deeply developing 
        robotics for defensive purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Autonomous robotic systems can monitor borders, respond to threats, 
        and provide effective deterrence, increasing the security of the entire Union.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The same technology can help southern countries manage migration flows, 
        offering humane and effective solutions for border patrol and monitoring.
