Events are accelerating. Trump's America is pushing for a radical geopolitical reorganization that will leave Europe exposed and vulnerable. The time for half-measures and bureaucratic delays is OVER.

Either we implement these reforms NOW, or we condemn ourselves to:
- Economic euthanasia in our old age
- Being carved up between American and Chinese interests
- Watching our retirement homes invaded by those who see our weakness as opportunity
- The collapse of everything our civilization has built

Every day we delay, our future security erodes further. In 30 years, today's younger generation won't have the numbers or resources to protect us in our old age. WE must secure our own future through decisive action TODAY.

**The ONLY path to a secure, dignified retirement for today's Europeans is a strong, integrated, and automated Europe. We can be the generation that saved Europe, or the one that let it collapse.**
