		</ul>
		...any <a href="/book/">many other potential services</a> that can be developed at the European level.
	</Card>

	<Card title="IV. Logistical Integration">
		* Creating a single, efficient autonomous robotic logistics market in the EU, for seamless goods transport across the EU, fostering a truly interconnected european economy. 
		* Ensuring packages of any size — from letters to containers — reach any corner of Europe within 48 hours.
		* Everyone, every individual and the smallest business, should have equal ease of transporting goods within the EU, trading goods within the EU, and delivering them to their customers. 
		* Autonomous Multimodal Transportation - developing an integrated system of self-driving vehicles, drones, and smart infrastructure to revolutionize goods and people movement across Europe. This includes utilizing roads, railways, waterways, and even air routes to ensure efficient and sustainable transportation. 
		* Minimize waste logistics: recycling, reusable packaging, circular economy, transport for recycling and reperation back to producers. 
		* Autonomous logistics can significantly enhance recycling efforts by enabling the collection of even the smallest items, like batteries, for recycling.
		* It can also handle atypical items, allowing for the transport of hundreds of fractions autonomously over long distances. When logistics are cheap and easy, materials can be better utilized.
		* Expanding the European high-speed rail network to allow overnight travel from any EU border to another, ensuring seamless connectivity.
		* Ensuring that any package, regardless of size, ordered online from any location within the EU can be delivered to another location by the next day.
	</Card>


	<Card title="V. Financial Reforms">

	</Card>

	
	<Card title="VI. Robotization">
		* Robotization is the new motorization. Europe must reinvent and reindustrialize itself as a robotized economy.
		* Germany should transition from the car industry to the robotics industry. By opening their automotive solutions to the European market, we can prototype and build on them.
		* Europe can't miss the robotics revolution. Without successful robotization, the EU risks becoming a secondary world economy. We are in this together.
		* Europe possesses a significant asset: a large number of Central European software engineers. They can be dedicated to building a new generation of robotics startups.
		* Robotization is the new industrialization. Europe will not be able to bring production back locally without outsourcing it to robots.
		* The key efficiency factor of future economies will be the level of automation.
		* Robotization also represents a new retirement system. It allows us to maintain the social contract and provide cheap local goods.
		* Robotization is the future, and I hope Europe will join it.
