# Language Integration: English as the Lingua Franca of Europe

## Vision

The Language Integration initiative proposes establishing English as a second official language in all EU member states, creating a bilingual Europe that preserves national languages while enabling seamless communication across the continent. This would be a cornerstone reform that brings immense economies of scale and unlocks the benefits of true European collaboration.
