EU Language Integration

Let's introduce English as the official language of the European Union and as a second official language in every EU member state!

On the national level, each EU member country would introduce "European English" as an additional official national language. On the European level, we would establish a "Board of European English," which would oversee our grammar, dictionary, and define word usage, for example, should we use "chips" or "fries"?

This would mean:

For you, this means that wherever you are within the EU, you would always be able to communicate—speak and complete forms—with local administrations in European English.

For businesses, it would simplify everything, from contracts to court proceedings, by allowing them to be conducted in English throughout Europe.

For the EU, it would become an English-speaking institution that produces documents legally recognized across member states, ending the era of translations.

Language integration is a reform that brings immense economies of scale, and it's possibly the most cost-effective reform we can introduce. It will increase efficiency across numerous areas by facilitating and unlocking the benefits of inter-European collaboration.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?
