Digital Europe: Building a Unified e-Governance Infrastructure for the Future

The state of the future is digital, and its administration must function as an integrated system enabling efficient governance and seamless interaction between citizens and institutions. If the European Union wishes to maintain its relevance in the future, it must actively participate in the development of digital administrationâ€”supporting and facilitating efforts toward digitalization and integration at the European level.

In the ongoing digital revolution, through collaboration among member states, we have the opportunity to transform public administration and services from the era of typewriters to the age of computers, the internet, and artificial intelligence. However, such modernization requires extensive effort. There is still a great deal of work ahead in this domain, as outlined in this publication.

Let us use the platform of European cooperation to build this software collectively, leveraging the benefits of scale that come from joint development.
