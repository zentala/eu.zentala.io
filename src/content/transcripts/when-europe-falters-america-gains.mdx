    "The geopolitical landscape is rapidly shifting, with the US deprioritizing European security",
    "Ukraine is struggling due to weakened Western support, while Russia continues its war effort despite losses",
    "Europe has failed to prepare for the consequences of American disengagement, investing only 0.3% of its GDP in supporting Ukraine",
    "A Baltic-Carpathian Alliance, or Intermarium 2.0, is proposed as a security pact among threatened European states",
    "The alliance would include Poland, Romania, Sweden, Finland, and potentially the UK, Czech Republic, and Slovakia",
    "Military-industrial cooperation and defense spending of at least 3% GDP among core members would ensure long-term security",
    "Ukraine's role would be pivotal, but immediate membership would be contingent on a stabilized situation",
