      <FAQ 
        color="indigo"
        items={[
          {
            question: "Why do we need yet another European integration project?",
            answer: "Unlike previous integration efforts, this vision focuses on practical, tangible benefits for all Europeans rather than abstract political concepts. By focusing on language, digital infrastructure, and robotic reindustrialization, we address the actual challenges facing Europe in an era of global competition and technological change."
          },
          {
            question: "Isn't English as a second language unfair to non-English speaking countries?",
            answer: "This proposal recognizes that English is already the de facto international language of business, science, and technology. Rather than starting from zero with a new language, we're acknowledging reality and formalizing it to reduce barriers. National languages remain primary, with English as a practical addition that enables greater European-wide communication and opportunity."
          },
          {
            question: "How will these changes benefit ordinary citizens?",
            answer: "Citizens will gain access to streamlined public services in multiple languages, enjoy faster cross-border shipping, benefit from enhanced AI-powered healthcare, access lifetime educational opportunities, and experience greater job mobility throughout Europe. The vision aims to create a Europe where everyday life becomes simpler, more efficient, and more prosperous for all."
          },
          {
            question: "What if Germany or other powerful countries don't agree?",
            answer: "If certain countries choose not to participate initially, this vision could begin as an Intermarium 2.0 project with countries like Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and Scandinavian nations. The benefits of integration would likely become apparent quickly, encouraging others to join. The proposal creates such clear mutual advantages that even skeptical countries would have strong incentives to participate."
          },
          {
            question: "How would this be funded?",
            answer: "This vision fundamentally changes how we think about funding. Rather than focusing on redistribution, it leverages economies of scale and efficiency gains. By building common digital systems once (instead of 27 times), sharing development costs, and optimizing processes, we create value that pays for itself through increased productivity, reduced waste, and economic growth."
          },
          {
            question: "How long would implementation take?",
            answer: "This is a long-term vision with a 15-20 year implementation timeline, with different components being rolled out in stages. Some elements, like digital payment systems or unified logistics standards, could be implemented relatively quickly (3-5 years), while others like full language integration would follow a longer timeline with gradual milestones."
