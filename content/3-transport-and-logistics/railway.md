I should be able to enter into high speed train at 10 PM in Wilno and wake up at 10 AM in Lisbona.
We should have a grid of high

why do we even using airplanes to travel across UE?
there is no reason to use a flight during european travel & we need to speed up it & make more avaliable
cheap and ecological (!) transport

it will increase tourism and economical grow especially in isolated regions like south italy, portugal, greece
it may and should be affordable for low-income class (where radicalism and nationalism is growing) what will support european integration
routes (examples, someone should draw a map)
warsaw > berlin > paris
paris > london
paris > barcelona > madrit > lisbona
belin > prague > wien > budapest > bukarest
via carpatia route
