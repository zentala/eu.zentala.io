* the vision is that I can ship a container from South Italy to Eastern Poland and all operations between posting and receiving will be done by robots, 100% autonomously; that should be cheap and fast
* that is crucial for parts of UE that are far away from the core; those parts of UE are developing slower because of costs of transportation, and low economical grow causes raise of populism and nationalism; we need to decrease costs of making business for those "country-sides", that will increase economical grow what will decrease centrifugal tendencies
* UE is pretty densely populous, but it's also hard to travel (terain is not flat and easy to travel)
* we need to improve transportation of goods, and make it cheaper, and greener
* we can use rivers, seas, rail and autonomyous transport
* and that should be part of european strategy
* we need to laverage our rivers and seas in order to transport as much goods as possible with autonomyous vehicles between them
* we need smart, autonomuous logistic stations, that will reload goods between ships/trains/etc
* Seas, eg.
  * beteen south italia and greece
  * between italia and corsa
  * autonomyus ships, are moving people and goods,
  * uk-netherland, uk-france
  * baltic sea
  * cyprus
* complement high speed rail (convenient interchange stations) for ppl
* basically we need cheap and green transportation for goods accross UE, and that can be done easily with autonomyous aqueous transport and autonomyous reloading stations
* and it needs to be UE strategy for UE industry
