This blockchain-based system could be written by an open-source community.

Blockchain is a public database of information. Its main feature is that this database is immutable - it cannot be changed without notifying everyone about this fact and the scope of changes.

This feature is making it valuable to store public information such as:
  * birth and death certificates
  * marriage and divorce certificates
  * car information - model, registration, insurance, ownership, etc.
  * property information - address, ownership, etc.
  * etc.

With some security features, it would be possible to store and share securly private informations such as:
  * medical data.

With additional roles and acess managment we can use it to securly store instiutioanl data:
  * police / accidents / criminal records, court documents, etc.
  * history in general...

its good to know for sure about what happend in the past, no one can manipulate the image o the past, so we can learn from it

The security of the suystem is based on the trust in the community. The open source solutions - like Unux systems - prooved it high reliability.

In the case of the e-government, the blockchain is used to securly store the information so in the future:
  * no phisical paper archive will burn again with all city recrds (distributed)
  * no govement offical can unauthorizly modify or steal / destriy the data (inmutable)

No oone can lie us about what happend. What was stored, is stored. Writen in the blockchain, is writen in the blockchain. Like in the fucking stone.
What was decided (transactions, votings) was decided for sure.

Bunch of apps based on blockachian can help us to switch institutions to a new system:
* autorization of citizens,
* users - citizens and organisations - roles and permissions
* election, votings and poll systems
* prosecutor, court systems
* if I will report something to the govement it can't disapeear from the blockchain


* self-organised communities can decide about their law
* local school can decide about thier school rules, eg parents can decide about what childs can be learned
* if you think, that law is against the constitution, you can report it
* when enough people report, public procecutor take the case and go to the court
* elected court will make a verdict about the law conform to the constitution
* if the law broken consitutuin in is withdrowed by the court authority, the old law is-reapplied automaticaliy, if not decied another

Basically we would have to recreate democratic institutions on the blockchain.
At the end we would have digital democracy - parliament and senate, voting, elections, etc.
But at the same time we would give more power to the people, enabling them to decide about their own way of living as much as we all consider moreal and acceptable (all users of the system who can vote about general political direction).

This could be a base of the new world order - global, open source, decentrlized liberal democracy.
I would call it ordered anarchy. There is still rule of low, but the level of elasticty of the law would be extreme.

Imagine, that inhabitants of a city / municipality decided they dont want 5G, WiFi and microvave anymore.
(we would add a constitutional provision requiring eg 90% of supportive votes and 90% of partycipants for such radical changes)
(basically we could perform diffeernt type of votings in diffrent cases)
But if they (those citizens who would like to block microwarves) would get enough votes, they are free to ban this technology in their area.

How would it benefit the society?  Is it a good idea?
We, European, we believe in freeedom so people can learn on their own by we all as the comunity we can learn in their sucesses and mistakes.
First of all, we are collecting data.. Maybe microvaes ban will affect something unexpected way. Integrating it into our system, we all can learn something from others.  Its good to enbrase diversity in the society.  Its good to test tessting different apooaches. We need a space for diversity, expermineting and learning.

Maybe some city will enable/legalise autonomous cars. Maybe it will be small city, build just to test them. People can organise on the land and set their own law to test their own way of living and way of dealing with each other. They would deal with responsibility and securiy of this soultuons on their own. This is freedom. Localy customized laws.

If some areas would like, they can applu set of rules. Eg there could be few set of rules about driving autonmous cars, and different areac could decide about their own. Only main roads, managed on country level, would be under govement control. In onther cases govement just give default recomendations, while local political units can overwrite their of skip the law update (it this is consistent with the constitution).

We need system, we need countrty to enable poople and oeganisations to sign custom contracts between each other. To organise around various set of laws (but still under one political system). This way we can produce various kinds of values and exchenge them. Maybe the era of mass culture is over and we need to lead in the era of mass customization. Maybe.... we can decentralize the culture, ways of doing things, while centralizing the protocols of how we decide about things and exchange values between each other.
