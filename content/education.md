* ~~Education sytsem should be designes on the economical needs and current reality, where future pupils will work.~~
* I need to shortly describe the future of work, linking it with the need that we need to fulfill and what to change. I could also contrast it with the old goals. Compare old goals, and how this system fulfill needs before and how needs to do it now.  
* 2 sentences in the thesis. dropdown with longer explanation?

# What we need from the education system?

Education should: 
* provide skills, that will allow us to have a good life, good job, some good money
