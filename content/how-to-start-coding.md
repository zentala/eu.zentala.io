* self organised developers teams can write software on their own
* we need to split the concept into multiple apps that can be maintaneed by open-source teams
* this way we can build a digital govement open source system
* there will be multiple counties and groups will finanlyy decide to use it if we provide the proper code quality

* how can we organise a proces of such developent? managment? arhitecture?
* I belive developers needs to manage themseles
* person from ourside it dont undestand topics so good to mange it
* so we need people who are already here

we need:
* busness analitycs to help define busines needs of such system
* UX/UI designders to make concepts prototyes for us
* develpers to write the code
* architects to ensure that the soluton (built from multiple microservieces/blocks) is scalable and maintainable
* tech leads to consult developers if needed, serve with expertise
* etc.

we need cooperation of variius IT people here
but at the stake is buiding a system that will democratise power and empower people
freedom is the idea we, hackers, had building linux, open source software and blockchaing
this is another way how community can repeat this creavtive miracle again

I woild prefer:
* the same people to swich between those roles, depends on the stage
* for devs to learn about UX/UI or business and for others to learn devlopment
* mix skills and persopecitves

I need a help about organise this project and move forward with organising volunteerrs developers.
In the middle time I am working on developing rough vision of the system and some loud around concept so developers will join. When it happend we neeed to be ready with ideas (maybe multiple) how to udilize their dedication. The biggest risk is that project will stuck becaose of liuck of leadership or managment....
