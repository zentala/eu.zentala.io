Euro failed in some areas
But we should provide people a way to easily buy and sell as before
We can create system for easy money exchange (blockchain) and force all banks to exchange money for free between all 27 EU countries
Every credit/debit card sold in eu should allow to pay in every eu country without any additional payments (fees)
