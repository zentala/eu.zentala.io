Environmental Protection

My vision of reforms consider how to make whole economy more sustainable: reduce carbon footprint and amount of waste.

Ussually real increasig of economy effecieny is on the way with reducing  the amout of resurces consumed (to produce, or waste, or provide services). Beacuse resources costs, its eficinet to the eceony to reduce the amount of resources consumed. This is the logic beiing of fruther modernization ideas:

## high speed european train:
 * there is no reason to burn fossil fuels when traveling accross europe,
 * we need fast and convinient transport, that would be more convinient then airplane
 * people needs to travel fast

## green transporation and management of social discontent while banning fossil fuels cars
* convinient autonpius transportation for mases is needed for fast switching from fosill fules driven vehicles into geen powered ones
 * eu set a polictical goal to redice carbon enissions from transportation
 * that will increase prices of the oil
 * probably fuels-cars prices will also grow while gren will be substitied or just tax exemted
 * that will make world a better place and masses rightly pissed off
   * cars will become too expensove for them
   * if I live in the center of big city I can use public communication or taxi, outside those ares u need a car
   * huge amonut of people need car to move variuous things for work
 * we need to make sure we providing them transportation while exchangeing vehicle types
 * as costs of workforce are increasing we need to provide them possibility to rent / share aunotnoous transponration
 * this should be supoorted now by EU so we could soon and easily replace ownershipe of old cars with temporaty renting new, green ones
 * consider owning a car as another form of carbon emission.
 * if u have a small company and u have a track that is used 2d per months  then we paid env cost of producing car that is doing noting
 * we also need to iterate fast with cars and vehicles development
 * if we share vehiceles, the time of their life will be shorter (higher uilisation in km during short periot) but on other hand everyone will have (shared) access to almost new devices
 * computers, digital and entertaiment systems will be almost new and therefore more convinient for everyone
 * we need to iterate fast what is car, what is travel, how we spend time in travels, so this high utilisation (via sharing) will help our producrs to iterate faster with ideas and new transportation technologies and concpts of what travel is
 * speeind up devleopemnt process, while not utilising more natural resources than needed, but rather genrate value from organisation and ideas
 * shared autonomous transportation is also the answer for crowded cities
 * we need mix of cycil and commercial autonomous vehicles (solutions)
   * it can be like an uber
   * or a carpooling service
   * or you can transport europallet or sea container autonomysly - just call service and it will move it for u where u order
   * this way companies can easiluy ship loads in eupe as well people can easly transport
* am moving from Netherlands back to Poland. I am ordering a container, put my stuff there, order a transportation to pl, robot takes contaner and drive it to my PL in PL and I am traveling via highspeed autonomus train separately
* if we will not propose people and busnesses alternative to using old cars and the way to own "greren" car cheap we will make them engry and they are right - its not onlu about them. we will exclude them from economoyt, from being free and posisible to make their jobs - taking back cars (high fuesl prices, taxation of using fusels cars - eg not allowed go to the citi center) will destroy society.
* sharing economy will also make producers to become more respiurces efficient during the lifecycle of product - no better way to make economy more eficinent in some area then to make it part of market equiasion somehow

### separating wheels / motor-driving base from cabines / tranks / load
 * we need to iterate and test new concepts, eg even if u have your own cabin and trunk, the driving system is exteranl and rented (shared) so even if you need to store some stiff in there for few days, you can still use it, u can "park" cabine, eg. if u are construction worker then your workshop can travel, moved by seoarated wheels and be left for few days without motors, when u dont need to travel
 * do u need to go store? motors will dive to you and take your cabin to the


# autonomous city-care and farming robots
* cigarettes butt issue
* one-use plastic reduction
* better batteries collection
* drones that monitor what are u burning in your heater (piec CO) and law that will allow that

* clean forest with unemployed / fired from public services (?)

* autonomiczny system produkcji rolnej aby zwiekszyc wydajnosc, powierzchnie produkcji rolnej (tak!) i wyjalowienie gleb
  * drones on the field
* we need to restore some grounds to nature.
  * eg 5ha per every 100ha should be leave alone and protected to provide space for animals
  * we already produce more food than we need, so we can do it easily

* zwiekszyc zalesienie, zwiekszyc laki

* promote skyscapers in order to decrease size of cities (hongkong gov scyscapers)
