As a europeans we are burning crazy amount of money for e administration. 
We are writing this software separately and we are not able to finish, because this is just to complex project and developers costs a lot.
Just think about that. Every 26 countries hire their own developers to build symilar systems. Does it make any sens?
Does italian dever needs different eDeverLicence then polish one? Why did we unify documents accros UE? To split the apps now?
It's not consistent. We are disintegration on the level of IT systems. It really matters. Every future political organisantion will base on highly complex IT systems. Just will have to. We need to digitalize administration. If we will split here, how will we integrate in the future?
Will italian deiver have to install german eDriverLicence in Gemranay and polish in Poland? Because this is it loooks now.

Developers are already crazy expensive. 
And required complexity of e administration is high
We need and we will need a lot of new features and gov appps. 
Let's build them together. 

Bulting common eGov core together require english as official (minimum technical) langugae. 
* We need to have documentation and variable/funcion names in english. 
* European developers are already write and talk in english, so this would be just a matter of format stuff.  
* We need one default UI languge to maintain, so the development team would focus on features develolment, not translations (that will be of course implemented). And that default UI langnege should also be english.

Digital integration will:
- reduce obstacles when using eGov services in other european counties (should I really install diffrent apps for diffeent countries?)
- provide equall access for all europeans to the digital govement services (the same standard, as we develop it together); reduce inequalities in the access to the digiral services (that will be more and more important during time, eg eVoting, that will matter for democary and culture if some countries will use eVoting and other not)
- release money that would be spent for redudant implementations of the same system that can be invested in innovations
- make europe really digital. for now europe is moving away from being digital. countires digtalizing itself, but UE not at all. time to digtalize UE.
- digital and european scale eGov is required for business!

# Role of eGov systems in the world political stability & china detraction
Future of govements and administration is digital. 
Whoever doubt that, should aready be sure after COVID pandemy. 
eGovement solutions become more important then ever during those times. 

United Europe has potencial to develop a world-class eGov solutions. 
Those solutions could and should be exported to the third counties. 
This way we will promote democratic values and ways of solving problems.

Let's me explain.

China already exports their IT eGov systems. With those IT eGov systems they export specyfic, totalitaric, way of ruling the country. With constantly growing role of those it systems, in middle-term (30y?), this process will push polliticaly (those countires who are using china egov software) torwards China and totalitarism.

If govement will have a stick, they will use a stick on their citizens. If they will have a carrot, they will use a carrot. 
China is selling it-egov-sticks. Let's grow and sell it-egov-carrots. 

What Europe can do for the world peace and wellbeing is exporting democary trough the technology, trough proposed it egov systems.
I believe, that the way we will digitalize our political systems and administration, will shape the next one/few hundreds years of political history. 


I would like to notice, that **for the first time in history we have a chance to provide all World citizens amlost equall access to one public service**, and this is **eGov** because everyone will have in 1-2 decades when digitalization will be pretty done. With "one simple trick" we could easily provide poor countries something that will increase their quality of live and productivity. Possiblity to open company, to learn online, to control medical data, to sign documents online, etc.

# Europe has potential to become a data-Swiss-bank for new gold (data)
With a strong tradition of personal freedom, word freedom, privacy, banking freedom we are in the best position to become a datacenter-Switzland for world. Data is a new gold. Gold need banks, where can be safely keeped. Where would you store the most secret and important information if you should have to store it somewhere? Where poor and destabilized country should keep their eGov data? Europe could be this place. Safe haven for the data. We are in the best position to take this role in global because of regualations and traditions that we already had.


# Build eGovernment core together
 
* we don't have money to do it professional alone
* we can have the best systems & most efficient all over the world
* this will integrate us, without forcing us to unified a law (but the way how the law is organisd will be the same as we will use the same system)
* this will help business grow
* this is also very innovative, we have resouces to do it and we can sell it around the world

## Ideas:
* The same digital sign across whole UE - must to have

### European Peoples Database
* we can track all immigrants & turists
* we can easily provide services for all UE citizens
* good start for european passport
* easier to make services for EU citiznes accross UE easily
* **that would be very usefull during COVID. UE should prepare mobile app for COVID tracking and this is required framework that we dont have**

### European Vehicles Database
I know. We have smth like that. But that should be easy. Just scan the plate with mobile app, touch your phone with owner phone to get authorization and recive acces to the whole car history and information. 

* car history across all 27 countries
* accidents, fines
* periodic vehicle health check
* owners, type of usage (eg taxi or another special usage)
* help police with car stealing, etc

### eruropean driver app ?
I even don't see any point why countries should have any own apps for car registration, insuarance, etc. that all should be in one ueropena app.

### Medical information database
your medical history can be shared across whole UE
we can easily identificate you with your fingerprint and eye scanning and know what happend to you and how to threat you
you medical insuarance info is also shared across UE & easy to check

### Departments Document Exchange System
sharing information between different departments in the country and outside
that should be a platform, that allows another countries to have separate law, but in the same time to exchange documents easily
we need european protocols for sharing, converting, requesting and exchanging documents accross institutions
we should standarize it and centralize the standarizaton proces now, untli suystems will be to complex to merge them!


### European Voting System WIP
* allow to vote on every level (from UE to local)
* that will also allow to decentralize UE law, keeping UE integrated by it system in the same time
* organized anarchy (?) as a new system
  * allow eu citizens to vote about polical vision
  * on the low level people should have a lot to say
  * on the higher level, people rights should be limitated, and replaces by proffesionals
  * eg parents can vote about LGBT lessons & religion in the schools
  * that will provide divesity, and help us to avoid home war
  * people can also say a lot about policies of their cities and regions
  * shoule we accept homosexual marriages
  * what religion laws should be introduced on the specfic area
  * they also pay on their own for they special local policies
  * abortion, euthanasy is legal in this region or not?
  * etc. all matters of world view should be individual matter of region and people living there
  * that will allow to create regions with they own cultures and world view laws and provide diversity
  * also on the low level people can stimulate economy and use local laws to stimulate business
  * allow aautonomyus vehicles
  * allow to install wind farms close to another ppl homes
  * allow make alcohols on thei own
  * basically they can owerweite public law in order to specialize region
  * but they will also have to pay costs for that on their own
* clients of public services vote on managers
  * who should be city head of the police
  * who should be head of the hostpital
* specialists vote on specjalists
  * doctors can vote for good doctors/specjalists/managers to promote them
  * the same teachers, officials, etc

# Smooth transformation to eGov WIP
dwoj-rzady
rzad biurokratyczny i rzad technokratyczny

playnne przejscie do nowoczesnego rzadu
* dwa rzady, stary - zapewniajacy plynnosc dzialania instytucji, nowy - wdrazajacy innowacje; stary rzad ma stworzyc podkladke legislacyjna pod te wdrozenia i taki sposob dzialania Panstwa po to aby zachowac plynnosc dzialania instytucji i ciaglosc prawa,
* w praktyce wyglada to tak ze instytucje dzialaja jak obecnie, szkoly ucza jak obecnie, ale nowy rzad decyduje aby w konkretnych placowkach wdrozyc inny program nauczania, i stary rzad robi specjalna ustawe ktora pozwala nowemu rzadowi zlecac takie rzeczy, tworzymy do tego procedury


## IT and robotics needs common framwework where can oparate 
licences, maps, person contacts, in order to make is scalable and easy to implement, in order to develop one european market for robotics and IoT we need to unify eGov core. we need those unified systems if we want to be albe use the same robots i autonomouys vehicles around countries. this is important. ue is about accessbility to markets. and our separated it systems are not accesible for robotics, europe is not digitally ready for iot and robotisc revolution. but we need to prepare if we want to have a bit of this cake. in other case we will still slowly die economicaly. we need on market for robotics, huge market, with the same or similar public it infrasturcture. this way we will create standards that will be esported. also thos way our european innowaciteve compoanies will acheive scale. that is very needed in those kinds of investmets. 

it should be easy for italian robotic company that is building homes with 3d printing, to come to poland, and use machine legalized in IT in PL legally, its important to have the same maps system for the robot, so it can position itself before start prointing the hause. that's another importnat (this time economically) for developing egov together. 

## privacy, control over data, control over code
* every cointry deoply susyems on their own. manage it on their own, on their own theritory
* there should be some exchange automatic system, so that's why protocols and data format unification is crucial
* it's possible to create european decentalized cloud for gov data, but not sure parties will be interested
* data backups could be randomly distributed on servers accross UE and encrypted
* we could (and proabaly should) track data access and integity with blockchain
* you can encryot a big file, make a control sum md5, save it in the blockchain and being sure for the lifetime that this file wasnt modyfied untill the control sum of the file match to the control sum on the blockchain
* we could also similar way, automaticaly, track and save access logs (to the data)
  


  # EU must take more active role in stymulating and implementing innowavations
Support middle companies & invest in innowaction
* i worked in french startup. But it didnt develope well. Because it earns money when solution is introduced with scale. 
* we (in UE) have thousets of hospitals that need better logistics, but we dont intrudce there modern solutions. govement should allow to grow startups in the same time introducing modern solutions in govements
* in some big cities we can build a skyscapers to move govement instututions there, and we can navigate accros those huge administration compexes with mobile apps
* we can automate clening of city and grow auropean innovatice companies on this
* we can produce self-driving buses, if we allow local govements to test it easily
* we can invest in autonomyos city cleaning
all of those actions could provide reveniue and we should invest in this direction
we need invest even beacuse our societeies are aging
