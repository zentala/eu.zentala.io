English is already _de facto_ 2nd official language in the EU.
It has been widely adopted across Europe by busines.
<add smth about IT and modern online education in english>
It is used daily by the younger generation for entertainment and other media purposes online.

For the past few year I have worked work for French, German and British companies where I've always spoken English.

It would be helpful for business and for EU citizens if they could do all required official tasks in English.

That would be a first step for a new stage of european integration - cultural integration:
* European-scale marketing companies,
* media,
* schools and universities (teaching in English),
<!-- * European scale movies and TV series,  -->

The whole creative industry will benefit from unifying language.

English as a common language will strengthen European integration and further shape and develop European identity.
Stronger European identity would help to stop growing euro-sceptic movements.

Potentially that could motivate the UK to rejoin the EU. UK would hugely benefit from participating in an english speaking EU.
<!-- opening them a way to increase trade (what is their specialization; they are struggling about leaving UE beacause it was consider as a bad deal for them; that would made it significatly better) -->

That could open the EU to integrate more strongly with all Anglo-Saxon countries (UK, Ireland, US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia).

Even if the EU falls apart one day, it would be easier to resurect it, if it had a strong operational foundation in the form of a common language.


I would propose a 20-year timeline with steps: (throughout the EU)
* decide on a deadline a date when all governments will have to use english as second language
* every museum or public place should be labeled in English (4y)
* every child learn at school as a second language (6y)
* every official document should be avaliable in English (10y)
  * in big cities / capitals 5-10y (we need to prepare bilingual documents)

every teenager should obligatory pass English on maturity exam (at the same level as native level)

* court proceedings should be possible in English (20y)


)
import american/british/australians by giving them secure and stable job position (hostages of Poland, that should provide some security)

W PE siedzą posłowie i rozmawiają miedzy sobą za pomocą tłumaczy. To jest skrajnie głupie bo:
pokazuje , że nie traktują poważnie integracji europejskiej
Nie mogą się autentycznie porozumieć nie umiejąc rozmawiac w tym samym jezyku
bo jak maja sie dogadac na korytarzach itd. To pokazuje ze ten czlowiek nie trakuje powaznie integracji. Jesli chce sie tym zajmowac to powinien sie zwolnic i uczyc jezyka w innym kraju.
