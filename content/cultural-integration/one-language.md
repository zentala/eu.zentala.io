English is already _de facto_ 2nd official language in the UE.
Is widely adoped across the Europe by busines and in almost daily use among younger geneation (online). 
I use to work in French, German and British companies. All the time I have been spoken english. 

It would be helpful for business and UE citizens if they would do all required formal job in european countries in english

that would be a first step for a new stage of european integration - cultural integration:  european-scale marketing campanins, media, schools and uinversities (teaching in english), european scale movies and tv series, whole creative industry will benefit from unifying language
cultural integration will support deep european integration and shaping and developing european identyty, what is crucial, cosidering growing euro-sceptits movements
potentialy, just potentialy, that could make UK come back to the UE; UK would hugely benefit partycypating in UE that is 
opening them a way to increase trade (what is their specialization; they are struggling about leaving UE beacause it was consider as a bad deal for them; that would made it significatly better)
that could open UE to integrate stronger with all anglo-saxons countries (UK, Irland, US, Cananda, New Zeland, Australia)
even if UE will fall apart one day, it will be easier to integrate it again we we will have a strong common base like common language
 
timeline 20y everywhere
set up a date when all governments will have to use english as second language
in big cities / capitals 5-10y (we need to prepare bilingual documents)
every formal document should be able to make in english
courts should be able to work in english too
every museum or public place should have english names/labels from now
every child learn at school as a second language and
in 10y every young person should pass obligatory english exam (as native, local language)
import american/british/australians by giving them secure and stable job position (hostages of Poland, that should provide some security)
 
W PE siedzą posłowie i rozmawiają miedzy sobą za pomocą tłumaczy. To jest skrajnie głupie bo:
pokazuje , że nie traktują poważnie integracji europejskiej
Nie mogą się autentycznie porozumieć nie umiejąc rozmawiac w tym samym jezyku
bo jak maja sie dogadac na korytarzach itd. To pokazuje ze ten czlowiek nie trakuje powaznie integracji. Jesli chce sie tym zajmowac to powinien sie zwolnic i uczyc jezyka w innym kraju.
