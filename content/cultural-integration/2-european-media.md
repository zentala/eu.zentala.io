european media

Develop european media as a platform for inter-countries European discussions
* common language is required in order to make it fast and easy
* press, that works mostly online
* sometimes printed, but mostly in big cities
* one-two tv channels, that works online and in real
  * Informational
  * Cultural
  * entertainment
* radio / online and physical one
* radio and TV: the best would be to have the same frequency across UE
* all of that would be a platform for discussions for european countries and their politics and journalist; we REQUIRE it to:
  * make debate more diverse (smaller and weaker countries are not heard well enough now)
  * reduce separatist and nationalist sentiments
  * discuss more complex topics and issues that we will have to face in fast-changing world
  * speed up europen debate, making decisions and integration (forcing decisions by few biggest players will not work anymore, UE needs to be more inclusive)
