## Reasons
Cultural integration is crucial for
* long-lasting peace and stability in Europe.
* economical growth in information economy

## Methods:
- english as formal language
- reduce role of national media
- develop and invest in european scale media and culture
- develop europen culture

The goal is to start making politycs in one language.
We have a complex problems to discuss together.
We are staning in front of 4th industiral revoliution.
New technologies that are borning now can kill daying euriope or give the europe the power to grow.
Threre is no way to stand and watch.

For example if we will not invest in eueropean media and lagunage, then russia will be still able to contuniee information war, where they produce differend kind of fake news for different nations and make them hostile against each other. We need one media, one languange and one culture to start real dialog.

We also need a language for a economic development. In the era of information economy, information geneate value. But translations are huge cost of spreading this value, of genertaiting it in scale, etc. We need infrastructure for cheper information exchange. This infrastrucure is one languge.

I want an Europe where europeans write their blogs in english and I am reading blogs of other europeans in english. I dont want to live in the bubble of polish media. And you also dont want to live in the bublee of your national media, if you want to be informed well. We all need access to the ifnromations and infomration echange, and our languages are huge barrier in spreading, shareing, exchanigng informations, pointos of view, in debate.

I want to watch european movies, I want to have an european social media. We need one language to have an eurpean social media. We need on language to get eniugh big scale to be able to grow global IT comapnioes.


I want to live in the europe where whole european parlament talk in the same languge. We can't be serious about european integration if we will have to translate what we are saying.

Europen Union may fail. Culture will reman and will help to reborn and to rebuild this project other way if need.
We need to think about the Europe in long term. What if EU will fall down? How will we integrate it again?
We are responsible against the future generations for the actions that we making in order to mainain peace on the continent.

But stop thinking about the future for the momemt. Take a look on what happens now.
Constant conflicts are blowing up the european stability and order.
It's difficult to find an aggrement, to find common intrests, understood each other points of views...
How will we prevent next european crisis? How and where will we communicate together?

I am not talking about politicians talking behind closed doors.
I am talking about european citizens.
Europeans, who menally drift-away from the european union.
Why do we even talk about Polexit? Italyexit? :)
Did we forget about the Brexit that already happend?
What lessens did we learn from it?

There are pretty big culturar differences between different parts of the europe.
How will we address them? Do we even understand them? Do we study them? How are we gonna understand and adress needs of those people, we we don't have direct communication with them?
How are we gonna rebuild the identity (create a new european) of those people if we are not talking directly to them?

Europe need something more than just ussuall busines to keep us all together durig those dynamic / fast-changing & hard times.
We need ideas and valus that will unify us.
But how to find those values speking so many languages?
How to find what we have in common if most of the politycs and public opinion are focuesd on national politycs?

We need to find a new puropse for the european union in new times.
New deal for the europe. Because europe also needs a new deal. Why don't we talk about it?
This is fucking hard work. A lot to talk about.
Better let's prepare to this massive conversation.

We can use this "zmiana systemu" as a chance, change to meet each other, move democracy to the next (digital) level and proof that we can find a solution.

To start those conversations together, as europeans, we need common languge and "real" / serious european media.

What do I mean by cultural integration? How can we integrate culturally?
We will integrate culturally during time if we will talk about politycs, economy and business using the same languange and discussing those topics in the same media. This way voices of every politycian and publicist will be noticed and heared by european, not national, audiency and receive euroepan (not national) feedback.

That will break a loop of stupid national-populists believs, help us to find a common narration, identyfy common probles, receive help and new perspectives for local problems, address problems together respecing each other intrests, grouping contires in blocks of intrests, etc.

Basically: european politycs will become much more important with this one simple trick (english as offical languge). No need to centralize the europe with more tractacs. No need conflicts about the law - because we will not centralize by the law, but the culture. Let's keep those conflicts away. Let's focus on something that doesn't botter anyone and will seve everyone.

What I mean again: In order to integrate culturally we need to talk together using the same langunage in the same media, that had huge european audience.

Thoughts:
* What is blocking the born of the european citizen are national languages.
* maybe we shoudn't relocate imigrants, maybe we should relocate europeans
* Be more framework, than regulator - that will attract people and that will let us iterate
* One language and infrastructure will unify people even if EU will fall apart finally
* we need to adjust roles for regions that become abbadoned - eg south countrues should produce solar power and go into industrial food more
* we need more transfering of people and knowledge accross ue (how?) - eg. education standards
