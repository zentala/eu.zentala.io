manufactures should be directly responsible for recycling of their products

in my opinione there is only one way to reduce amount of produced thases - they need to come back to the manucastures 
manufactures should be directly responsible for the way of how product was recycled
they need to collect the used prodcusts in their recycle logistics centeres and figure out they way how to reuse what they produced next time
or pay a taxes for generating trashes. they should be also directly responsible for segregating and stoing trashes (that cant be recycled)
so they need to think about the recycling and storage of trashes when they produce
we need to use a market meachinsms to make manufacutres pay for what they generate

and there is a few ways to make them responsible

thanks to smart transportation & logistics we can make a manufactures directly responsible for recycling of their trashes
they will have to directly collect and recycle their own homappliacnes, vehicles, etc. this way they will be able to reuse old components and being able to design products thinking about their recycling. 


Thanks to system of autonomous logistics we could finally just re-send product to the manufacterer recycling centre. We could recycle this way p
can force producers to collect and recycle products such us their AGD & RTV products
* we can force them to recycle furnitures, parts of cars etc
* we can also force producers to provide replacements parts
* we can force them to mark products as fixable or not, and then for fixable products parts have to be avaliable
* we can also add a lablel "open source product" when a open source documentation is avaliable
* replacements parts could be delivered via this autonomyus system; damaged parts would be sent back
* that would create an econnomical preasure of the producers to made a recycable products (because cost of recycling would be a part of the price, and producers compeet about prices)

products of specyfic categories like batteries:
* manufactures must to partycypate in some organizations that collect batteries (eg next to the stores), then split the costs of collecting, they can recycle separately or together. there can be a few companies that collect batteris
* vehicles - just smart logistics sends it to the producer or to the company that recycle it for him 
  * so yu have a french car, its not a good idea to send it to the france. there is a local company that have a licence for recyclicng/ they took car. disband all eeasy recycable stuff, spearete everythinbg accoring to the producer instructions. common materiall i can send on my own, but rare or hard to recycle I send materials for recyclig/storage exactly where producer decided. producer is resposnidle for those procedueres, for instructions how to separate parts and even for payment for this kind of separation.
  * cigartette butts - robots that are collecting them + bill for cigarette companies according profit from the market. and they need to recycle collected butts. we separate them and they need to receive it and recycle. 

spearation is crucial. 
we need to be able to separate trashes very precisly
we are not doing it now, because we dont collect small fractions
with autonomous robots we can do it.
all stores can collect batteries, all prahamcies medecines

there should be possiblity to order robot to send specyfic fractions of trashes:
- car tiere
- electronics
- wood / furnitures
- we need like 30-60 factions or even more

We need to be very specufic what and how we collect it. 
And we need a ML to help us to separate stuff. 

With cola or other buttles. We can just separate plastic buttles that we can recognise and send them back to the producers.
i know. that will make a lot of fractions, a lot of stuff to send. yep. but why we dont automate it?

it's too much for a govement to think how to recycle trashes they even dont know how to produce.
onluy thing that govement should be responsible is to retuerning trashes directly to the manufactures and make them pay depending of env damage they generate
and we need to invite producers to help us to recognise they trashes, and help us to make a logistics centres.

even if we deicde to burn cola buttles to generate heat, we need to hacve a data form the producer what type of buttle do i see, how to recycle it, 

we need some kind of smart system that will help us to bsically count, match, track, sort our trashes

i dont have clear vision of how to do it yet, but it's totatlly doable in the age of machine learning. 
it's also easy to have a very graduated types of trashes when computers will be responsible for segregating them
