# manufactures should be directly responsible for recycling of their products
and there is a way to make them responsible!

Thanks to system of autonomous logistics we could finally just re-send product to the manufacterer recycling centre. We could recycle this way p
can force producers to collect and recycle products such us their AGD & RTV products
* we can force them to recycle furnitures, parts of cars etc
* we can also force producers to provide replacements parts
* we can force them to mark products as fixable or not, and then for fixable products parts have to be avaliable
* we can also add a lablel "open source product" when a open source documentation is avaliable
* replacements parts could be delivered via this autonomyus system; damaged parts would be sent back
* that would create an econnomical preasure of the producers to made a recycable products (because cost of recycling would be a part of the price, and producers compeet about prices)
