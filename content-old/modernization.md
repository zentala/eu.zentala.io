# Modernization

**Modernization makes nations rich.**

Modernization is everything when it comes to rivalization of political systems. At the end what matters is who's economy is more efficient? Who can archive the higherst scale and profit margin from production and who is controling the flow of the international trade. This is how nations become rich.

This book is all about modernization.



This is how moderinze institutions, how to make new, great, possibilities for business, how to accelerate economical growth even more greener way, while making more money.

Being rich nation is not bad. Being rich can be needed to achive carbon neutrality. In any case we shoudn't confuse ecology with degrowth. There is no way bac

**Nation is a fluid construct based on common intrests.**

When I say nations, I don't mean any specyfic or even existing nations. Nation is fluid cultural construct. 200 years ago polish chaplain boys didn't indentyfy with polish nation. They sabottaged fight of polish aristocracy for independence. Today some of those peasants childrens wants to finght for Great National Poland. Nationality is a fluid construct that can be created or rebuilt pretty fast.

**We can build new national identifications**

I belive, that national identification is fluid and can be easily build on common intrests and common culture. When political system fails and rebuild again, we can organise people around new "deal", new social costruct and build new national identification around that. In case of EU we can and probably should preserve old national cultures, cultivate then and support ALL AROUND UE, keep it as some kind of way expresing ourselves that makes our perspectives, skills and predisposition more diversified. But we should unlink it with teritory. In deed better utilisation of this unique mix of differsivied european people could drive new wave of great economical growth in ue.

**common business**

Every modernization is huge effort. What can justyfy this kind of effort? Good plan. Promise of huge reweveniues?

But it's still to big effor for any of single EU conntires. Even Germany, the engine of the European locomitve, is too weak.

We need a common business. Nothing unite people more then common business.

We, europeans, already found some common intrests. But fruther integration requress more of them.

But, thre is a good new - modernization is on the way of creating this comoon intests.

There are some profits of scale, that we can achive only by moving forward with european integration:
* digitalization, why we even write digital gov systems on our own? Every european country separately? What a waste of human work!
* why companies can't use european digiral invoice and there is no european digital sign used comonly to sing all documens?
* why can't I solve my personal stuff in ue counteirs in englis? whats the problem to have mulit-lingual forms everywhere? to hire few peope who speak english in every gov institution?
* why didnt we develop european high-speed railway system so we could reduce flights aroud the europe?

Modernization, that will speed up our economy and create new

* why thousands of IT workers can't move to the South Europe and work remotely having nice weather and spening money there? we need to support this kind of internal migrations


EU knows that we need to keep together, to have economy that can achive some scale, so we could be big enough to play some role in the global economy. But in my opinion we (as EU) did't make enough in this direction. European common market should help us to build european champions, but where they are? Where is european facebook, Amazon or Tesla?Ongoing Industrial Revolution created a empty space, blue ocean, where we, as a Europe, we could develop great innovative products. Products that later we could export

But only if we will play togeher. Only if we will archive huge scale, and that can be possible only if we will decide to modernize together.

 Yes, I claim, we - europeans - don't play together strong enough to grow. We can and we should use a platform of eur



Today more then before we need to stay united in order to stay big enough to be heard internationalay.

I choose Eruropean Union as an example of the modernization, because wellbeing of the EU is close to my heart as well its great platform to build a modern country. Netherless huge amount of those ideas can be implemented in other political organisms or be a foundation for new political organisms.


**Culturre**
Common busines is directly connected with building a comon culture.
* space to discuss about our future - media
* way to live all around UE, to accelerate internal migrations
* base for real common european ecommerce and digital market
* faccilitate development of european-scale companies
* help to organise

Common culture doesnt mean to drop our cultures. It's just some kind of consensus of basic social norms, that will help us to cooperate together.
