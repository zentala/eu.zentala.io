Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning are tools that gives us huge possibilies in the health care industry to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care.

* medial data scientists  teams working on top of medical data, for new medical discoveres
* helping people with disices on big data and via digital systems

medical sicentits are seing some corleations or seeing some patterns in the data.
for that we need to provide them data
then we need to allow them to test and verify their hipotesis trough our medical system

we should also reduce the buirocracy of the midecal sytstem in whole eu
eg in PL every medical visit is around 5-10 minutes of burocracy, while 50-70% can be reduced

we should also automate prevention
- we should have a system that can predict the risk of a disease
- support doctors in analitycs of health data and results, considering past medical data
- include genetic data

lets start with providing everyone high qiality prevention thanks to big data, ml
this is cheap (cheaprt then healing) solution and significatnly improve qualuty of life
this is what good govement own to the people

then lets use medical and big data to provide preemoium serives connected with genetics and perosnalized medicine
bigger scale- better results
we can compare different variants of algoritms itd.

next steps would be personalized, pointed and targeted medicine
we need data for targeted medicine. that can make us possible to create uniq mix of medies just for you case

exptrmaly personilized and high qualut thereapy for everyone partycpating for small marin cost
we - developers - can build this kind of systems now
onluy what is blicking us is the way how we are orhgnised
so lets change it and engage scientists and engineers to make it better
