Zbudujmy europejskie media - platformę unijnych międzynarodowych dyskusji

Transport
Zbudujmy autonomiczną kolej szybkiej prędkości poprzez UE
Cultural integration
Introduce English as a 2nd official language of each of the 27th countries




Years ago CCP introduced Mandarin as the primary language for China. It’s time for European Union to introduce English as a primary European language for similar reasons. 
Increase mobility 
Open new business opportunities
Decrease costs of entering to the EU market (startup from small country have bigger chanes to success because of easier access to the european market)
Lower costs for business eg. you can sell and support in english, especially in B2B what de facto is already a fact
Scale. It’s a huge change for eg. media and ads industries.
timeline 20y everywhere
set up a date when all governments will have to use english as second language
in big cities / capitals 5-10y (we need to prepare bilingual documents)
every formal document should be available in english too
courts should be able to judge in english too
every museum or public place should have english names/labels from now
every child learn at school as a second language and national language
in 10y every young person should pass obligatory english exam (as native, local language)
 ? import american/british/australians by giving them secure and stable job position (hostages of Poland, that should provide some security)
Still irish are speaking English. We can also create European English in time. That’s no shame. 
that could keep UK in UE, opening them a way to increase trade (what is their specialization; they are struggling about leaving UE beacause it was consider as a bad deal for them; that would made it significatly better)
that could open UE to integrate stronger with all anglo-saxons countries (UK, Irland, US, Cananda, New Zeland, Australia)
even if UE will fall apart one day, it will be easier to integrate it again we we will have a strong common base like common language

Develop european media as a platform for inter-countries european discussions
Average young european person learn most about others european cultures from american Netflix
common language is required in order to make it fast and easy
press, that works mostly online
sometimes printed, but mostly in big cities
one-two tv channels, that works online and in real
Informational
Cultural
entertainment
radio / online and physical one
radio and TV: the best would be to have the same frequency across UE
all of that would be a platform for discussions for european countries and their politics and journalist; we REQUIRE it to:
make debate more diverse (smaller and weaker countries are not heard well enough now)
reduce separatist and nationalist sentiments
discuss more complex topics and issues that we will have to face in fast-changing world
speed up europen debate, making decisions and integration (forcing decisions by few biggest players will not work anymore, UE needs to be more inclusive)



Transportation
Build high-speed autonomous railway across UE


why do we even using airplanes to travel across UE?
there is no reason to use a flight during european travel & we need to speed up it & make more avaliable
cheap and ecological (!) transport
I should be able to enter into high speed train at 10 PM in Wilno and wake up at 10 AM in Lisbona
it will increase tourism and economical grow especially in isolated regions like south italy, portugal, greece
it may and should be affordable for low-income class (where radicalism and nationalism is growing) what will support european integration
routes (examples, someone should draw a map)
warsaw > berlin > paris
paris > london
paris > barcelona > madrit > lisbona
belin > prague > wien > budapest > bukarest
via carpatia route
more
Autonomous multimodal transportation across UE
The vision is that I can ship a container from South Italy to Eastern Poland and all operations between posting and receiving will be done by robots and autonomous vehicles, 100% green powered; that should be cheap and fast.
That is crucial for parts of UE that are localized far away from the core (Grece, Spain, Portugal, South Italy). Those parts of UE are developineg slower among others because of costs of transportation. 
Low economical grow causing a raise of populism and nationalism.
We need to decrease costs of making business for those "country-sides", that will increase economical grow what will decrease centrifugal tendencies.
UE is pretty densely populous, but it's also hard to travel (terain is not flat and easy to travel)
we need to improve transportation of goods, and make it cheaper, and greener
we can use rivers, seas, rail and autonomyous transport
and that should be part of european strategy
we need to laverage our rivers and seas in order to transport as much goods as possible with autonomyous vehicles between them
we need smart, autonomuous logistic stations, that will reload goods between ships/trains/etc
Seas
beteen south italia and greece
between italia and corsa
autonomyus ships, are moving people and goods,
uk-netherland, uk-france
baltic sea
cyprus
complement high speed rail (convenient interchange stations) for ppl
basically we need cheap and green transportation for goods accross UE, and that can be done easily with autonomyous aqueous transport and autonomyous reloading stations
and it needs to be UE strategy for UE industry

New, European, standardized and digital streets naming system on top of current one, where all streets names have a number too, for easy addressing, tourists, easier integration etc.  

Finance
One payment zone instead one currency zone
Euro failed in some areas
But we should provide people a way to easily buy and sell as before
We can create system for easy money exchange (blockchain) and force all banks to exchange money for free between all 27 EU countries
Every credit/debit card sold in eu should allow to pay in every eu country without any additional payments (fees)
New europeran cryptocurrency on top of euro and national currencies
We can't be sure if euro will survie, we need a backup plan for scenario if it will not survive
Having a one currency in UE would help us to manage payments, we still need common currency
So let's make new currency, that rate is a average of rates of all 11 currencies used in UE (Euro, Bulgarian, British pound sterling, Croatian kuna, Czech koruna, Danish krone, Hungarian forint, Polish złoty, Romanian leu, Swedish krona, Swiss franc)
Having it as cryptocurenty would help us to dominate digital market and it could be a wordwide payment standard
Inspired by Libra of Facebook and cryptocurrency that China wants to build too

eGov core
We are spending huge amounts of money to develop the eGov systems. We are spending this money separately - every country on its own. Such a waste of money! Let’s build a common eGov IT system for all EU countries. Only this way we can get really innovative eGovement. There is no better place all over the world to build a modern, innovative e-govement then Europe. We have a great culture, strong democratic values and all required know-how and workforce. 

If we will not develop democratic eGov, then China will export the system they already have - a system that is based on totalitarian values. That will increase chinese influence and totalitarianism all over the world. We should propose an alternative! Our, european solution, that is based on democratic values. That is not only about us, about Europe, but about the shape of the whole world in the future. Digitalization can’t be stopped. IT solutions that will be implemented during next decades will define the shape of political systems all over the world for decades or even more. 
Build eGovernment core together
we don't have money to do it professional alone
we can have the best systems & most efficient all over the world
this will integrate us, without forcing us to unified a law
this will help business grow
this is also very innovative, we have resouces to do it and we can sell it around the world
European Vehicles Database
car history across all 27 countries
accidents, fines
periodic vehicle health check
owners, type of usage (eg taxi or another special usage)
help police with car stealing, etc 
European Peoples Database
we can track all immigrants
we can easily provide services for all UE citizens
good start for european passport
easier to make services for EU citiznes accross UE easily
easier to punish people

Departments Document Exchange System
sharing information between different departments in the country and outside
that should be a platform, that allows another countries to have separate law, but in the same time to exchange documents easily
European Voting System
allow to vote on every level (from UE to local)
that will also allow to decentralize UE law, keeping UE integrated by it system in the same time
organized anarchy (?) as a new system
allow eu citizens to vote about polical vision
on the low level people should have a lot to say
on the higher level, people rights should be limitated, and replaces by proffesionals
eg parents can vote about LGBT lessons & religion in the schools
that will provide divesity, and help us to avoid home war
people can also say a lot about policies of their cities and regions
shoule we accept homosexual marriages
what religion laws should be introduced on the specfic area
they also pay on their own for they special local policies
abortion, euthanasy is legal in this region or not?
etc. all matters of world view should be individual matter of region and people living there
that will allow to create regions with they own cultures and world view laws and provide diversity
also on the low level people can stimulate economy and use local laws to stimulate business
allow aautonomyus vehicles
allow to install wind farms close to another ppl homes
allow make alcohols on thei own
basically they can owerweite public law in order to specialize region
but they will also have to pay costs for that on their own
clients of public services vote on managers
who should be city head of the police
who should be head of the hostpital
specialists vote on specjalists
doctors can vote for good doctors/specjalists/managers to promote them
the same teachers, officials, etc


Medical information database
your medical history can be shared across whole UE
we can easily identificate you with your fingerprint and eye scanning and know what happend to you and how to threat you
you medical insuarance info is also shared across UE & easy to check

The same digital sign across whole UE


Energy

Build solar power plants in south
* South european counties are in economical crisis. Building huge solar plats there is not only efficient but it will also provide works
* We can produce huge amount of clean solar energy there
* Clean doesn't mean poor

Organize North Africa
* We can secure Sahara and North Africa to get huge amounts of clean energy and that could be long-term job for a France
* Then we can build huge and heavy industry there. Providing jobs there will stop immigrants

---

## Organize post-russian Eastern Europe
* Poland can organize eastern countries in post-russian realty for Western Industry

## Let's support Govement Services with modern technologies
* me working in localization copany and hospitals that need it



## Philosophy
* people will travel, with or without UE, let's help them in this
* it's better to integrate inside UE, then with imigrants, as the first on will increase unify in EU
* Be more framework, than regulator - that will attract people and that will let us iterate
* We need to think in long term. What if EU will fall down? How we will integrate it again?
* One language and infrastructure will unify people even if EU will fall apart finally
* we need to adjust roles for regions that become abbadoned - eg south countrues should produce solar power and go into industrial food more
* we need more transfering of people and knowledge accross ue

## Customized local law
* Some cities may wants to develop autonomyus cars, we need low that will allow them that
* Other cities may want to invest in wind energy, they need to allow build wind plants without permission - let's allow them that
* Some counties have internal fights about world view; let's allow some to intruce abortion and another to disband

Support middle companies & invest in innowaction
I used to work in French startup (Real Time Location System solutions) company. But they did not grow well. Those kinds of companies earn when their innovative solutions are introduced with scale. It was hard for them to find a big client. 

Chinese and Singaporean governments are offering their companies a space, law and possibilities where they can develop systems that have great scale. Then their companies export those solutions and bring money back to the economy.

Eg. RTLS can save a lot of money in hospitals (better logistics). We (fast aging societies) need better hospitals. Our governments should help those kind of startups to develop solutions for our hospitals in order to improve healing efficiency for citizens and support their own business by investing. 

We need to have a plan of introducing european innovations into economy in scale in order to grow economically fast. We need to rebuild how we provide public services and make it modern way with european business. 

* in some big cities we can build a skyscapers to move govement instututions there, and we can navigate accros those huge administration compexes with mobile apps
* we can automate clening of city and grow auropean innovatice companies on this
* we can produce self-driving buses, if we allow local govements to test it easily
* we can invest in autonomyos city cleaning

## Environmental Protection
* there is no reason to burn fossil fuels when traveling accross europe, we need fast and convinient transport, that would be more convinient then airplane
* we need to restore some grounds to nature. eg 5ha per every 100ha should be leave alone and protected to provide space for animals
 * we already produce more food than we need, so we can do it easily
* cigarettes butt issue
* one-use plastic reduction
* better batteries collection
* drones that monitor what are u burning in your heater and law that will allow that
* clean forest with unemployed / fired from public services
* autonomiczny system produkcji rolnej aby zwiekszyc wydajnosc, powierzchnie produkcji rolnej (tak!) i wyjalowienie gleb
 * drones on the field
* zwiekszyc zalesienie, zwiekszyc laki
* promote skyscapers in order to decrease size of cities

## Educatoon
* proof of skills - i can go to university, make tests and get proof on my skills that are accepted in whole ue
 * programing languages
 * phisics, math, geography, biology, history
 * languages
* kazdy ma obowiazek edukacji, takze dorosly


COVID-19 update:
Szybka kolej w UE: promowanie turystyki wewnętrznej z powodu COVID. 
Sprawna możliwość załatwiania spraw przez internet (eLearning, eMedycyna, eGov) stały sie jesszcze wazniejsze. Sami nie zbudujemy dobrych systemow IT takiej skali. Za drogie. Zbudujmy wspolnie Unijne. Zacznijmy inwestowac we wspolne rozwiazania eGov jako UE.

Wierzę, że wdrożenie poniższych idei mogłoby być kolejnym krokiem w integracji Unii Europejskiej. Co więcej, krokiem, który po prostu ma sens, bo wszystkim nam się opłaca.  wszyscy by przystali, a długoterminowo zintegrowały nas kulturowo, co scali Zjednoczoną Europę silniej, niż jakakolwiek instytucja . Rządy i systemy polityczne będą mogły się zmieniać, ale kultura która może nas złączyć dzięki postulowanym reformom - pozostanie. Cokolwiek się nie stanie, ta kultura, będzie bazą do kolejnej integracji zapewniając długoterminowy pokój na kontynencie.
